Ever wondered why every website wants you to setup a new login. OK nowadays you can use Facebook or Google to login into many services.

But why can't we as users have one login that we can use to login to all these services?

DirectLogin is an open source project and a not for profit organization (not yet registered) that aims to provide the building blocks for solving the multiple login situation we currently have.

Service providers will gain by not having to re-invent the wheel and have fewer support requests with users forgetting their usernames and passwords among other benefits.
