Ever wondered why every website wants you to setup a new login. OK nowadays you can use Facebook or Google to login into many services.

But why can't we as users have one login that we can use to login to all these services?

DirectLogin is an open source project and a not for profit organization (not yet registered) that aims to provide the building blocks for solving the multiple login situation we currently have.

Service provider will not have anything to lose just lot less users forgetting usernames and passwords.
