  Ever wondered why every website wants you to setup a new login. Nowadays you can use Facebook, Twitter or Google to login into many services but it's still not convenient.
</p>
<p>
  Why can't we as users have one login that we can use to login to all these services?
</p>
<p>
  DirectLogin is an open source project and a not for profit organization (not yet registered) that aims to provide the building blocks for solving the multiple login situation we currently have. Consider is as a single sign on for the web.

  Service providers will gain by not having to re-invent the wheel and have fewer support requests from users who forget their usernames and passwords among other benefits.
